TLDR: Steps to create on a new Java application in 2020

# Why? Oh God Why?

This was a thought exercise to see if running a Relay style GraphQL server was viable in Java! So don't fret dear reader, we've still got some hip, newfangled technology thrown in here. I have not built a Java project from scratch since 2016, and it depended on IBM proprietary build system. This post servers as a collection of my thoughts as I embarked on creating a Java based GraphQL server.

## First things first, how to manage Java versions like it's 2020?

I am definitely not going back to managing Java versions or my dependencies through a UI after living in the sweet, sweet world of usable Python and Node CLI tools.
So I set out to find a Java versioning system and stumbled across: `jabba` https://github.com/shyiko/jabba
`jabba` works pretty much like `nvm`

So to get started:

```
# Install jabba
curl -sL https://github.com/shyiko/jabba/raw/master/install.sh | bash && . ~/.jabba/jabba.sh
# for fish shell users
curl -sL https://github.com/shyiko/jabba/raw/master/install.sh | bash; and . ~/.jabba/jabba.fish

# Install OpenJDK
jabba install openjdk@1.13.0

# Set the system to use OpenJDK 1.13.0
jabba use openjdk@1.13.0

# Verify JAVA_HOME is working!
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

## What about dependency management?

How to handle dependency management. If this was on a more corporate system I would opt for Bazel. This walkthrough is intended for individual developers / small teams.

Now we could go with the tried and true Maven, but I wanted to do a check Google first. It seems like Gradle (https://gradle.org/) is the way to go. It apparently combines Maven and ant. If it allows us to not touch `.xml` I'll cry with joy.

```
# Install gradle
brew install gradle
```

It is probably recommended to add the gradle-completion (https://github.com/gradle/gradle-completion) to your shell. I'm still trying to figure out how it works in `fish` (https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/blob/master/share/completions/gradle.fish). Is it built in???

## Autoformatters!

We shouldn't have to think about spacing, line length, or anything like that in 2020.
Just write code. Think about logic. Get things shipped.

To do that we'll crutch on the Google Java Style guide (https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

We will use `google-java-format` https://github.com/google/google-java-format to adhere to the standard.

```
# Install google-java-format
brew install google-java-format
```

## Visual Studio Code Extensions

Unfortunately I have been burned by Eclipse and IBM RAD to many times. With this in mind, we will be sticking with Visual Studio Code. This is a hard requirement. If we have to launch any more intensive IDE we'll cut this project entirely.

Thankfully the Visual Studio Code website has an entire page dedicated to setup up the editor for Java! https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/java

To start, install this collection of extensions for Java development:
vscode:extension/vscjava.vscode-java-pack

There is a whole host of other extensions they advise to install, but we'll come back to those later.

## Initializing a new project

So how do we start a new project with gradle?
A quick demo can be found here https://guides.gradle.org/creating-new-gradle-builds/

I will simply assume you followed the demo. My thoughts on it are as followed:

- why Groovy or Kotlin? What is so wrong with JSON configs? There is probably not many people editing the config file's AST...
- during development I realized, I did not have an auto formatter for Groovy!

To start I added a Gradle Spotless Plugin: https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.diffplug.gradle.spotless
