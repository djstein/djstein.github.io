## Hey all!

This is going to be my new personal website.

What you can find here:

- Blog posts. Mostly technical. Moving away from Medium due to some of their gatekeeping features and a need for more control over my content.
- Information and videos about talks and events I will be attending.
- Open source project information and details. Please feel free to reach out to for help from here! However I will be less active on open source technology because of current contract with Apple.
- Photography for personal and professional portfolios.
- All my actively used social media and contact information.

I will be working on setting up a no-ads, blog only email subscription soon. (Possibly RSS if requested!)
