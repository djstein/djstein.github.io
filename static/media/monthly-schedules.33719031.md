_TLDR: Some talk about a scheduled life._

Life is a lot easier when you automate it.

Small, incremental effort compounds.

Not completing everyday tasks can have lasting effects that are hard to recover from.

If we break up mundane life tasks, schedule them, and complete them we see a better future for ourselves. Breaking them up and not having them on your mind at all times leads to less mental overhead when it is time to complete them. It is easier to clean a few things in your house every incrementally than do everything all on one day.

We also know that skipping these tasks can be take exponentially longer to recover from.

It is FAR better to keep doing these tasks than to skip or delay them.

A few examples of scheduled, repeatable tasks, that can be negative if not completed include:

- regular exercise
- cleaning your living space
- paying bills / debt
- contributing to savings / retirement accounts
- going to classes / furthering education
- regular dental hygiene / dentist visits
- putting fuel in your car / regular maintenance
- related work upkeep (practicing new skills, posting social media content, writing blog posts)

We know we need to do these tasks and tasks like them, but when to do them and a reminder to do so is a great mental overhead. I believe that automatting these tasks and their reminders can greatly benefit everyone. I would anecdotally claim it is especially useful to those who have trouble starting things or suffer from anxiety / ADHD / depression.

## A Scheduled Life

We can break up the majority of tasks into subcategories: Self Care, Exercise, Errands, House, Work, Social

### Daily Tasks

These tasks mainly include self care. Say, flossing your teeth or practicing a skin care routine. These tasks will not see immediate results. Instead they will lead to a general better overall quality of life per every month / year practiced.

Examples:

- Self Care: flossing, skin care
- Exercise: workout, take progress photos
- Errands: quickly check finances
- House: wash dirty dishes
- Work: clearing out inbox, completing today's goals
- Social: posting on Twitter, texting friends

### Weekly Tasks

These tasks include things that can't be done every day.

- Self Care: flossing, skin care
- Exercise: take measurements
- Errands: buy groceries
- House: regular laundry, quick vacuum
- Work: review weekly goals / plan for next week
- Social: medium effort social media posts ie. Instagram / Blogs

### Bi-Monthly Tasks

Tasks that need to be done semi regularly but are too time consuming to do every week.

- Self Care: exfoliate / deep clean
- Exercise: take a rest day
- Errands: stock up on housing supplies (paper towels, cleaning products)
- House: launder linens
- Work: check-in's with manager
- Social: meet with friends

### Monthly Tasks

Things that

- Self Care: haircuts
- Exercise: check progress on weight and fitness goals
- Errands: pay rent and other bills
- House: deep clean!
- Work: log tasks that can be used for yearly review
- Social: host or go to an event / concert / etc

### Semi Yearly

This category includes tasks like updating your wardrobe, tax preparation, vacations, or going to the dentist / doctor for check ups.
Having these scheduled and in your calendar will ensure you don't go a whole year without doing these things!

## Closing

I have implemented my schedule through a combination of the Calendar and Things apps. I have recurring tasks for pretty much everything, giving me a detailed list of what I need to do every day on all my devices. This way I don't have to worry about what I may need to do or what I forgot to do.

Thanks for reading. Maybe this will be some good thoughts for going into the New Year / accomplishing those resolutions.
