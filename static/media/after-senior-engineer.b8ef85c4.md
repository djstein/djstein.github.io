**[DISCLAIMER: This post is joking about the seriousness of "burnout", however if you are feeling depressed or need help please check out the information from SAMHSA.gov!](https://www.samhsa.gov/find-help/national-helpline)**

Over the past few weeks, the "community" (Twitter / HackerNews / Dev.io / reddit / etc) seems to be talking a lot about burnout and career changes. (Maybe this coincide with death marches before the winter holidays?) Some common themes that lead to burnout and wanting a new career include:

- "feeling like a cog"
- "no growth / trajectory"
- "not learning"
- working long hours for someone else to reap the benefit
- management doesn't care / see the problems
- no longer fun
- and everyone's unique situational problems

All that leads to burnout. What happens after burnout you might ask? Engineers try to solve their own problem: being unhappy.

# The Options

## Continue being a senior engineer

This itself has two choices:

1. Stay at the current company and deal with it. Probably the worst outcome.
2. Jump ship and distract yourself with a new job / project / and hope for the better

Choice 1 is usually for those with golden handcuffs or who have been dupped into believing things will get better. (For those reading: if it's already this bad, it won't magically get better. Taking care of yourself is #1. Time to go! Proceed to Choice 2.)

Choice 2 is advised by the masses en mass. Usually a senior engineer is in the position where they have options. When entering the job market they can tailor their search for traits that would make them happier. The typical 2020 list (from most realistic to least) includes:

- shorter commute
- more compensation / better benefits
- flexible working hours
- tools they would like to use / know
- remote work
- a better work culture
- a better manager
- a project you're passionate about (without a pay cut)

If you can find a job with at least 3 of these traits, there's not much reason not to take it. However this choice usually results in the same cycle of the previous job. After all, work is just work. Customers, managers, and deadlines don't go away because of a new job. At least it's better than the last one, right?

## Management

So you're tired of being a senior engineer. By moving off the individual contributor (IC) track you can take on a new challenge: people and HR! This situation also changes if the management option available is a technical position or not.

If the position is technical you may still be responsible for the same tasks you did as an IC, but you must now be a ticket jockey and HR representative. Be wary of this position. You would rather be responsible for your team's long term vision, than worry about how CRUD APIs are implemented.

The hard part is getting into management. While a senior engineer has options when switching jobs, it is very difficult to move into a new company as a manager with no experience in that position.

If you're at an early stage startup, you may have the opportunity to become a manager quickly! This might mean you're the only senior managing the juniors. This may not turn into relevant, transferable experience. However you will be a manager in title and can make a transfer easier.

Typically you'll have to stay at your current company, work very hard to become a project lead, then begin managing the other senior ICs without the title. If the need finally appears for a middle manager between you and the person managing you and the other ICs your name "might" come up on the shortlist. You will be competing with other ICs and managers from outside your company trying to switch into this role. Not great odds.

However for this exercise, let's assume you become a manager. Congratulations! You probably won't receive a great compensation increase for the increase in work, but you have unlocked the management career ladder. Take this in stride as every year you will actually have new challenges and you may enjoy them.

New tasks from moving into entry level management include:

- explaining technical details in a simplified form to upper management
- wanting to tackle technical debt you are aware of from your IC days, but never getting resource to do so
- protecting your ICs from other managers and product managers
- dealing with your direct reports' personal problems interfering with their work
- being on the chopping block when issues for your products arise
- learning how to promote your team and build credibility within your organizations
- building your team up to deliver more value
- attempting to find value in your work
- slowly burn out your directs and make them want to jump ship as you forget why you moved into management

## Sabbatical

Maybe you work at a company with an above average benefits program. You may find yourself with the ability to take an unpaid sabbatical where you can refresh your mind and come back later with a new perspective. This is a great option for those with golden handcuffs. Unfortunately this is probably not an option for those without golden handcuffs because it is something only companies that give you golden handcuffs can provide.

Downsides include:

- loss of pay for the time you are not working
- product and team move forward without you, your return back may be difficult
- the things that caused you problems will eagerly be waiting your return

## Start your own company

Another prescribed option is to start your own company! This could probably be it's own blog post. Some quick highlights include:

- no people to manage you! (until you get customers, venture capital partners, a sales team, ICs, etc.)
- you get to work on the product YOU want (until you get customers, venture capital partners, a sales team, ICs, etc.)
- work when and where you want (until you get customers, venture capital partners, a sales team, ICs, etc.)

However, if you are up for it, starting a company is one of the most stressful and humbling experiences you'll ever have. You can hire a team of ICs and cause them to burnout. And if you're product doesn't hit hockey stick growth after product market fit, you can always move into middle management at your old company. This seems like a sure win.

## Leave it all behind

Maybe the answer is that the engineer never wanted to be an engineer. Maybe you'll trade your golden handcuffs for a coffee shop or early retirement. This option strongly recommends you do not code as a hobby for fear of starting your own company.

While this post is a bit tongue and cheek, I believe many engineers are struggling with the burnout / "what's next" problem. The options don't seem to promising either. I worry this is a problem space someone in Silicon Valley will try to write a SaaS for, while the real solution may be regular therapist visits and workplace boundaries.
